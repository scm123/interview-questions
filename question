=========================================


Comparable v/s	Comparator
1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.	The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2) Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.	Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.	Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.	A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.	We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.



HashMap	v/s Hashtable
1) HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.	Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
2) HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.	Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
3) HashMap is a new class introduced in JDK 1.2.	Hashtable is a legacy class.
4) HashMap is fast.	Hashtable is slow.
5) We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code
Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);	Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized.
6) HashMap is traversed by Iterator.	Hashtable is traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.
7) Iterator in HashMap is fail-fast.	Enumerator in Hashtable is not fail-fast.
8) HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.	Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
